How to Style console.log Contents in Chrome DevTools:

This is a list of CSS format specifiers and their respective outputs.

Specifier	Output :
 %s	 Formats the value as a string;
 %i or %d	 Formats the value as an integer;
 %f	 Formats the value as a floating point value;
 %o	 Formats the value as an expandable DOM element. As seen in the Elements panel; 
 %O	 Formats the value as an expandable JavaScript object;
 %c	 Applies CSS style rules to the output string as specified by the second parameter;

 To add CSS styling to the console output, we use the CSS format specifier %c. 
 Then we start the console message, 
 which is usually a String with the specifier followed by the message we intend to log, 
 and, finally, the styles we want to apply to the message:

console.log("%cThis is a green text", "color:green");
